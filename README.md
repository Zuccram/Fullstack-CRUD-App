# Fullstack Crud App

# 👋 Hi, I'm Marcus !

Frontend Developer and Backend Developer with a strong focus on **React, Javascript, and interactive UI experiences**.  
I enjoy building and solving features from scratch, understanding how things work under the hood, and writing clean, testable code.

### 🚀 Project Overview

I have build using **React and Javascript**, using **Node.js and Express** to achieve a good beginning to something better.  
This project was created primarily for **learning and experimentation**, with a strong focus on functionality rather than responsiveness.
